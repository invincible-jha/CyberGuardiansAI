This repository aims to create a more comprehensive agentic AI framework for cybersecurity, surpassing existing frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen. The focus is on developing sector-specific agentic AI frameworks that address the unique challenges and requirements of different industries.

## Key Components of the Comprehensive Agentic AI Framework

1. **Modular Architecture**: Design the AI framework with a modular architecture to allow for easy expansion and integration of new components.
2. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms, real-time monitoring, and anomaly detection to identify and respond to threats.
3. **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensure data encryption, access controls, and audit trails to protect sensitive information.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Incorporate necessary security controls and measures to meet sector-specific regulatory requirements.
5. **Collaboration with Experts**: Work with industry stakeholders, government agencies, and regulatory bodies to ensure comprehensive protection and compliance.
6. **Scalability**: Implement load balancing, horizontal scaling, and efficient data storage solutions to handle increased workloads.
7. **User-Friendliness**: Design an intuitive user interface, provide comprehensive documentation, and offer customization options.

## Benefits of Sector-Specific Agentic AI Frameworks

Sector-specific agentic AI frameworks are better than generalized ones because they:
